The dentate gyrus model was initially developed by Calvin Schneider,
Ivan Raikov, and Marianne Bezaire at University of California, Irvine,
and later substantially revised and rewritten by Ivan Raikov, Aaron
D. Milstein, Grace Ng, Darian Hadjiabadi, Prannath Moolchand at Stanford University.

This model of a dentate granule cell was taken from the following
paper and modified by Ivan Raikov:

Pedro Mateos-Aparicio, Ricardo Murphy and Johan F. Storm (2014). 
Complementary functions of SK and Kv7/M potassium channels in 
excitability control and synaptic integration in rat hippocampal 
dentate granule cells. Journal of Physiology 592, 669-693.

It is based on the model of Aradi & Holmes (1999; Journal of 
Computational Neuroscience 6, 215-235) which uses an idealized 
morphology (DGC_Morphology.hoc). The model was used to help 
understand the contribution of M and SK channels to the medium 
afterhyperpolarization (mAHP) following one or seven spikes, as 
well as the contribution of M channels to the slow 
afterhyperpolarization (sAHP).
