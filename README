paper and modified by Ivan Raikov:

Pedro Mateos-Aparicio, Ricardo Murphy and Johan F. Storm (2014). 
Complementary functions of SK and Kv7/M potassium channels in 
excitability control and synaptic integration in rat hippocampal 
dentate granule cells. Journal of Physiology 592, 669-693.

It is based on the model of Aradi & Holmes (1999; Journal of 
Computational Neuroscience 6, 215-235) which uses an idealized 
morphology (DGC_Morphology.hoc). The model was used to help 
understand the contribution of M and SK channels to the medium 
afterhyperpolarization (mAHP) following one or seven spikes, as 
well as the contribution of M channels to the slow 
afterhyperpolarization (sAHP).
